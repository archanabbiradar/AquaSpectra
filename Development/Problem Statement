The health and lifespan of aquatic life in aquariums depend critically on maintaining ideal water quality.
But conventional techniques for analyzing the quality of the water frequently lack accuracy and efficiency, posing a risk to the local population.
Inaccurate evaluations may lead to imbalances in ammonia, nitrites, nitrates, pH levels, and other elements that stress, sicken, or even kill aquatic life.
It is also difficult for aquarium hobbyists to maintain a steady and healthy environment because manual monitoring procedures take a lot of time and are prone to human mistake. 
In order to guarantee the best possible aquarium wellness and the wellbeing of the aquatic residents, it is imperative to have an advanced water quality measurement system that provides accurate, real-time monitoring.
